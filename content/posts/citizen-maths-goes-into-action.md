  A poor grasp of maths currently affects 17 million British adults and is
  affecting the UK’s productivity growth as a result, according to the Bank of
  England’s chief economist. And in a recent survey, despite 61% saying they
  left school with a maths qualification, over half admitted their maths wasn’t

A poor grasp of maths currently affects 17 million British adults and is affecting the UK’s productivity growth as a result, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist. And in a recent survey, despite 61% saying they left school with a maths qualification, over half admitted their maths wasn’t good enough on a day-to-day basis.

That’s where [Citizen Maths](https://www.citizenmaths.com/) comes in. It’s a MOOC style online course using practical, everyday problems and activities grouped under topics known as ‘powerful ideas’ to bring everyday maths to life.

Working closely with Calderdale College, the UCL Institute of Education and partners, we developed the Citizen Maths brand and produced the core content for the online course. We filmed a series of tutorials so learners feel as though they’re having a one-to-one session with a skilled teacher and produced the practical exercises and quizzes that make up the 35-50 hours of online learning.
