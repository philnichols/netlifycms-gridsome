It’s caused great division here at DESQ. Some of us argue that it’s terrible – weird, creepy, totally over-elaborate learning for what is quite a simple process.

While some of us believe that this is another example of KFC’s legendary suite of marketing exploits, including a chicken bucket that prints photos, a $10,000 dollar tent to block out the internet, and fried chicken Christmas baubles.

And maybe we did learn how to make better fried chicken along the way as well.
