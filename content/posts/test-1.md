One of our Senior Producers, Liz, was excited and honoured on Thursday afternoon to be invited to St James’s Palace as a guest of Waitrose for the Princess Royal Training Awards ceremony.

Liz spent a delightful afternoon in the company of Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal and the 39 other winners of this prestigious award, happily fuelled by champagne and extremely nice cakes.

We developed the ‘Stocktopia’ game as the ‘cherry on the top’ of a blended learning stock management programme designed to reduce wastage and increase availability. To date, Waitrose have generated £152.9m of additional sales, and £6.4m of profit.

It’s fantastic when the projects you work on have such incredible outcomes, and an invitation to the Palace was an additional gloss on a successful and enjoyable project.
