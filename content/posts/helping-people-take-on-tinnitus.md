**The hearing condition tinnitus affects one in three of people in the UK, and British Tinnitus Association (BTA) wanted to give sufferers free support and advice outside their helpline hours.**

We kept things bright, light and easy with a Take on Tinnitus interactive site that unpacks the condition using a conversational tone with strong imagery and design. Videos give personal insights into living with the condition and interactions encourage users to think about how the advice can be applied to their lives.

In the first 6 weeks, the site had almost 400 registered users with this sign-up rate showing no sign of slowing down.
