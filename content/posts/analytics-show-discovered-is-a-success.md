A link to the site is sent to all new starters as part of their induction pack. There are around 300-350 new starters per year, so other people at Discovery Networks International have clearly been attracted to the site.

There have been over 22,000 page views in total with an average user viewing 13 pages. Around 25% of users are being drawn in deeper still, browsing through more than 20 pages. The visually stunning tailored solution is clearly doing its job exceptionally well – engaging people and encouraging them to find out more about Discovery.
